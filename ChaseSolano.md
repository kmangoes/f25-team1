## About Me
I am a Junior at UNC Greensboro majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. My favorite programming language is Java, and my favorite IDE to use (if it can be counted) is VS Code. My favorite extension from VS Code is 'Bongo Cat', which hits a bongo every time you hit a key. Outside my major, I enjoy lots of different hobbies, but my main goal besides graduating is training to fight Muay Thai. 

## My CSC-340 Goals
I hope to have a lot of the more intimidating aspects of the Computer Science field- mainly, applying my programming knowledge in a practical way- demystified, so that I can feel like I have actually gained skills of substance throughout my time studying Computer Science.
