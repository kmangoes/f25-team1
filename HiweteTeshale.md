## About Me
I am a junior at UNCG majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics and a concentration in Data Science. Outside of coding, my hobbies include reading, going on walks, gardening, and cooking. I love spending time with my siblings.

## My CSC340 Goals
I am excited to apply my coding knowledge to this course through a self developed project. I wanted to have experience coding in a more general and real-world applicable manner as opposed to class assignments. I am super exicted to get started!
