## Title 
> Coffee Quest Application 
## Team Members
> Hiwete Teshale, Chase Solano
## Description 
> This application will serve as a tool for students across UNCG's campus to easily find coffee shops in the Triangle Area that other students love. Students will be able to verify their attendance to our school with their @uncg.edu email, as well as see peers of theirs that are also on the app. 
> The goal of this app is to provide a unique aspect of companionship across the student body; coffee shops are a busy student's favorite backdrop for group project discussions, solo cram sessions, and casual study dates. 
## App Functions
> SysAdmin: 
    i. User access can only be verified by a proper @uncg.edu email; if the email does not align with the format of a school email, the user will not be able to use the functionality of the app, as this is meant specifically for UNCG students and faculty. 
    ii. Services will be moderated based on the number of users, and how many of the features the user makes use of (i.e., creating their custom favorite drink, updating and rating which coffee shops they've visited, etc.).  
    iii. Users can leave reviews with a 1-to-5 star pop-up window implementation. For more specific feedback, rather than boring users with prompts to give written reviews, they will be prompted with efficient questions that they can answer using the 1-to-5 star system.
