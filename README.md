## Description
This mobile app will be used by UNCG students to find local coffee shops. The social media platform can be used with friends, with each one rating coffee shops they went to and the study-ability, comfrot, accessibility, and of course, taste of the coffee. The app will help students find anew places outside of campus to study and mingle with freinds for a change of scenery and allow them to explore the area.

## App Functions
1. Customer:
    - The customer will have a "My Person" icon on their screen where they are able to add or modify their coffee selections upon account creation.
    - The customer will be able to see nearby coffee shops and their ratings which will be done usign Google Maps API.
    - Chase: Subscribe to avaibable services
    - Chase: Write reviews for subscribed services
2. Provide:
    - The providers will be able to verify that users are UNCG students.
    - The providers will keep the application up to date with the latest information on the coffee shops, adjust their ratings, and ensure they are accurate.
    - Chase: Customer Stats
    - Chase: Relpy to reviews
3.  SysAdmin: 
    - User access can only be verified by a proper @uncg.edu email; if the email does not align with the format of a school email, the user will not be able to use the functionality of the app, as this is meant specifically for UNCG students and faculty. 
    - Services will be moderated based on the number of users, and how many of the features the user makes use of (i.e., creating their custom favorite drink, updating and rating which coffee shops they've visited, etc.).  
    - Users can leave reviews with a 1-to-5 star pop-up window implementation. For more specific feedback, rather than boring users with prompts to give written reviews, they will be prompted with efficient questions that they can answer using the 1-to-5 star system.
